  abstract = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of
                 land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and
                 familiar part of the natural world. But this type of
                 complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation.
                 This paper explores an approach based on simulation as
                 an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird
                 individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of
                 a particle system, with the simulated birds being the
                 particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock
                 is created by a distributed behavioral model much like
                 that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their
                 own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an
                 independent actor that navigates according to its local
                 perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of
                 simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of
                 behaviours programmed into it by the {"}animator.{"}
                 The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the
                 result of the dense interaction of the relatively
                 simple behaviours of the individual simulated birds.},
